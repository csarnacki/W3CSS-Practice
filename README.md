# W3CSS-Practice

This file is similar to the Bootstrap file I have in another repository where this file simply contains practice code for using W3CSS.

This file specifically contains only three sections of W3CSS and those are a dismissible alert, a responsive navigation bar and a button that displays a dropdown menu upon hovering over it.

I chose only these three sections because when it comes to frameworks, I prefer using Bootstrap over W3CSS, however, I do prefer using W3CSS code for these sections. I find that the W3CSS code for creating a dismissible alert is much simpler than using Bootstrap and there is no JavaScript needed to complete the action. Similarly for the dropdown menu to appear when the button is hovered over, I prefer the code compared to Bootstrap as I find it easier and simpler.

The reason why I prefer the navigation bar in W3CSS is by using the "w3-mobile" style wrapped inside of a "w3-container" element grants me a responsive nav bar that will shrink or grow based on the screen size which is perfect for mobile users.
